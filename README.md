Elderease

A Smart Delivery Assistance System for Elderly Residents in Gated Communities

1. Introduction

Elderease is a mobile and web-based delivery assistance system designed to support elderly residents in gated communities by providing seamless access to essential services such as groceries, medicines, laundry, and water delivery. The project focuses on improving accessibility, independence, and real-time communication between users and service providers.


2. Problem Statement

Elderly individuals in gated communities often face difficulties in accessing daily necessities due to mobility constraints, lack of technical familiarity, and dependency on others. Existing delivery platforms are not tailored to the specific needs of elderly users, such as simplicity, clarity, and real-time order status visibility.


3. Objectives

- To develop a user-friendly mobile application for elderly users

- To enable real-time order placement and tracking

- To provide a web-based interface for shopkeepers to manage orders

- To ensure efficient communication using push notifications

- To design a scalable backend using Firebase


4. System Description

The system consists of:

Mobile Application: Developed using MIT App Inventor for elderly users to place and track orders

Web Portal: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for shopkeepers to receive and update orders

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and synchronization

All components communicate in real time to ensure consistency and reliability.



5. Features

Multi-service ordering (groceries, medicines, laundry, water)

Real-time order tracking

Role-based authentication (customers and shopkeepers)

Image upload and retrieval using Base64 encoding


6. Technology Stack

Frontend (Mobile): MIT App Inventor

Frontend (Web): HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database



7. System Workflow

User places an order via the mobile application

Order data is stored in Firebase

Shopkeeper views the order through the web portal

Order status updates are pushed to Firebase

8. Scope of the Project

This system is intended for use within gated communities and can be extended to support additional services, payment gateways, and administrative monitoring features.


9. Future Enhancements

Integration of online payment systems

Voice-assisted ordering for elderly users

GPS-based delivery tracking

Admin dashboard for analytics and control


10. Conclusion

Elderease demonstrates an effective approach to leveraging mobile and web technologies to address real-world challenges faced by elderly residents. The system improves service accessibility, reduces dependency, and enhances overall quality of life.
