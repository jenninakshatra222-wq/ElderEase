Elderease

A Smart Delivery Assistance System for Elderly Residents in Gated Communities

1. Introduction

Elderease is a mobile and web-based delivery assistance system designed to support elderly residents in gated communities by providing seamless access to essential services such as groceries, medicines, laundry, and water delivery. The project focuses on improving accessibility, independence, and real-time communication between users and service providers.


2. Problem Statement

Elderly individuals in gated communities often face difficulties in accessing daily necessities due to mobility constraints, lack of technical familiarity, and dependency on others. Existing delivery platforms are not tailored to the specific needs of elderly users, such as simplicity, clarity, and real-time order status visibility.


3. Objectives

- To develop a user-friendly mobile application for elderly users

- To enable real-time order placement and tracking

- To provide a web-based interface for shopkeepers to manage orders

- To ensure efficient communication using push notifications

- To design a scalable backend using Firebase


4. System Description

The system consists of:

Mobile Application: Developed using MIT App Inventor for elderly users to place and track orders

Web Portal: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for shopkeepers to receive and update orders

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and synchronization

All components communicate in real time to ensure consistency and reliability.



5. Features

Multi-service ordering (groceries, medicines, laundry, water)

Real-time order tracking

Role-based authentication (customers and shopkeepers)

Image upload and retrieval using Base64 encoding


6. Technology Stack

Frontend (Mobile): MIT App Inventor

Frontend (Web): HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Firebase Realtime Database

### 7.How to Run the Program

***Prerequisites***

Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge

Active internet connection

Firebase Realtime Database configured

MIT App Inventor account

### Running the Shopkeeper Web Module

Open the project folder.

Locate the file named new 2.

Open the new 2 file in a web browser.

The new 2 file acts as the main interface for shopkeepers.

From this page, shopkeepers can navigate to the following service pages:

Groceries

Water

Laundry

Medicals

Each service page displays orders related to the selected service.

Shopkeepers can view order details and update order status.

All updates are stored in Firebase and reflected in real time in the mobile application.

### Running the Mobile Application

Open MIT App Inventor.

Import the project (.aia file).

Verify the Firebase database URL.

Connect an Android device or use the MIT AI Companion.

Run the application.

Users can place orders and track order status in real time.


8. Scope of the Project

This system is intended for use within gated communities and can be extended to support additional services, payment gateways, and administrative monitoring features.
